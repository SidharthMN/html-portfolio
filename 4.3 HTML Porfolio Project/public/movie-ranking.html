<h3>Triumph of the Will (1935)</h3>
<p> A propaganda film documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. It's a powerful example of visual propaganda used to glorify the Nazi regime and Hitler himself.</p>
<h3>Olympia (1938)</h3>
<p>A two-part documentary film about the 1936 Berlin Olympics. While seemingly about sports, it was used to showcase the supposed strength and modernity of the German nation.</p>
<h3>Der ewige Jude (The Eternal Jew) (1940)</h3>
<p>A deeply antisemitic propaganda film that aimed to demonize Jewish people through hateful stereotypes.</p>
